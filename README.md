## 🎮 Overview
A feature-rich single-player RPG developed entirely in **Pygame**, featuring exploration, combat, crafting, and interactive environments.  
Every system — from NPC dialogue to resource gathering — was coded manually over one month.

Free assets were sourced from **itch.io**, and audio was edited using **Audacity**.  
Although some parts need polishing, the game is **fully playable and stable**.

All systems — from combat to saving — were designed modularly for future expansion.
